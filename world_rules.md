# World rules

## Natural Imperatives

* NI01: All species have a self mutuality < 0

The more dense a species grows it will annoy itself, otherwise they will grow indefinetelly

* NI02: Predators have a growth rate < 0

Any species with a growth > 0 can survive without any food, even if everything else is negative

* NI03: The summed mutuality of a simbiotic relationship must be lower than the summed self mutuality

If we simplify a simbiotic relationship as if it were a single species, it would violate rule NI01

## Soft rules

* SR01: The higher in the food chain, the more negative is the growth and self mutuality

Predators density usually is lower and harder to maintain than more resilient organisms
